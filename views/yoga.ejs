      <h3><li>What  is yoga?</li></h3>
        <p>
          Yoga is a holistic practice that originated in ancient India. It combines physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), meditation, and ethical principles to promote overall well-being.
        </p>
       <h3><li>Do I need to be flexible to do yoga?</li></h3>
        <p>
          No, flexibility is not a prerequisite for yoga. The practice itself helps improve flexibility over time. Start where you are and progress gradually
        </p>
       <h3><li>What should I wear to a yoga class?</li></h3>
        <p>
          Wear comfortable, breathable clothing that allows for a wide range of motion. Many people prefer leggings or shorts with a moisture-wicking top.
        </p>
      <h3><li>What type of yoga is best for beginners?</li></h3>
        <p>
          Hatha or Vinyasa yoga classes are often recommended for beginners. These styles focus on foundational poses and provide a good introduction to basic yoga principles.
        </p>
      <h3><li> Do I need any equipment to start practicing yoga?</li></h3>
        <p>
          A yoga mat is the most basic equipment. As you progress, you may choose to incorporate props like blocks, straps, and bolsters for support and alignment.
        </p>
        <h3><li> How often should I practice yoga?</li></h3>
        <p>
          Consistency is key. Aim for at least 2-3 sessions per week. Starting with shorter sessions and gradually increasing duration is a good approach.
